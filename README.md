# Misc Code

This is just a repository of miscellaneous programs and scripts I've written that are either not generally useful or not finished enough to be released in any real fashion. Most of it is sourced from either stuff written for uni classes or scripts written for some hyper-specific task in my work or personal projects.

The main use of the code found within is as to use as an example or to copy bits of methods for other projects (the reason I've put them here is because it makes it easier for me personally to do exactly that).

I am currently in the process of uploading random doodads and such from my computer to this repository, so there will be more updates in the following days/weeks.
